Users can interact with the game using mouse clicks. Try to get matching pictures with as few as possible moves to get higher scores.

## Game SETUP
Simply run index.html on a web browser like Chrome of Firefox.

## How to Play
Click on one card, then click on another card. If they match, they will change colors. If they don't match, when you click on a third card the previous two will flip.
The game ends when you match all 8 pairs of cards.

You will loose one star for every 12 moves. You use one move each time you flip two cards.
At the end of the gam you will see your score results.
